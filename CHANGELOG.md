# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Daily briefing** (`briefing`): calendar, reminders, mail, tasks, weather and headlines in one spoken
  minute; schedule it with an automation.
- **Apple Shortcuts by voice** (`shortcut`): Home scenes and lights, Focus modes, music, your own shortcuts.
- **Screenshot search** (`find_screenshot`): finds screenshots by the text in them, read on the Mac.
- **Meeting action items to Reminders** (`meeting action=reminders`).

- **Meeting notes, no bot** (`meeting`, menu bar ▸ Record meeting):
  - Recording: `MintRecorder` (new Swift helper, `launcher/recorder`) records the call's audio through
    a Core Audio tap, which needs only the "System Audio Recording" permission, plus your mic, as two
    tracks.
  - Output: Gemini writes a timestamped transcript (You vs. the others, names when said) and notes:
    decisions, action items, open questions.
  - Where it goes: the Meetings folder.
  - Offer: Mint offers to take notes when a call starts.
- **Teach by showing** (`teach`): Mint watches you do a task once and saves it as a skill with
  parameters. Passwords are never recorded.
- **Tutor mode** (`tutor`): "show me how to…" points at each control on screen and moves on when you do
  it.
- **Edit selected text by voice** (`edit_selection`): rewrite, fix, shorten, translate in place, in any
  app.
- **Documents to spreadsheet** (`make_spreadsheet`): many PDFs, scans or receipts into one .xlsx (new
  dependency: openpyxl).
- **Tidy a folder** (`tidy`): a plan first, then apply, then undo. It never deletes.
- **Instant commands:** "volume 30", "next song", "pause", "mute" run the moment you stop talking,
  never twice.
- **"Which memory did you use?"** (`memory_used`).
- **Mint storage folder** (Settings ▸ Storage & Privacy, or by voice): everything Mint makes goes into
  one folder with Documents, Meetings, Videos, Agents and Spreadsheets.

- **Watching videos** (`watch_video`):
  - What it takes: a YouTube, X, Vimeo, Loom, TikTok or Instagram link, a video or audio file, or
    "this video" on screen.
  - What it gives: what the video is, the key moments with timestamps, and its look and feel (from
    about 12 scene-change keyframes on one contact sheet, plus measured pace and colours).
  - How speech is read: captions when there are any, otherwise Gemini transcribes it in parallel
    two-minute pieces (optionally `parakeet-mlx` on the Mac).
  - Follow-ups and frames: follow-up questions are answered from the cache, and `at` shows an exact
    frame.
  - Tools: frames come from AVFoundation and audio from `afconvert`, so no ffmpeg is needed. Web
    videos come through `yt-dlp` (new dependency).
  - Sub-agents with web access can watch videos too.
- **Automations** (`automation`):
  - Triggers: once, daily at a time on some days, every N minutes (optionally between two times), a
    new file in a folder, an app opening, N minutes before calendar events.
  - Actions: Mint does it, a sub-agent does it, or a notification.
  - Safety: automations never send, buy or delete.
  - When Mint has unloaded: Mint Ear starts Mint when one is due.
- **Tasks that last** (`task`):
  - Plans are saved and survive restarts and "stop" (which now pauses the task).
  - Steps can be split into sub-steps (3.1, 3.2), replanned or annotated.
  - "Where were we?" resumes with the outline and notes.
  - `step_done` records what was checked.
- **Memory:**
  - Without a TypeSafe key, filing facts, replacing outdated ones and recall now use Gemini Flash
    Lite instead of word matching.
  - Changed facts keep their earlier value.
  - Relative dates are stamped with the day they were said.
  - A daily tidy merges duplicates and drops facts whose date has passed, logging every change.
- **The journal** (`recall_history`): "what did we do yesterday?", "when did I ask about flights?",
  "what did Astra find on Monday?", answered from the conversation history, tasks, automations and
  videos.
- **Activity timeline** (opt-in): the app, window title and page address in front, text only, for
  14 days. It answers "what was I working on?" and "how long was I in Slack today?".

## 0.1.2 (2026-09-28)

- A developer handbook ([docs/development.md](docs/development.md)): running from a checkout,
  where new code goes, testing, building the Mac app and releasing.
- One app: the screen-control engine behind the `desktop` tool (from jev-use / Desktop Voice) is
  now built into Mint.app as `MintEngine`. It starts on demand as part of Mint, uses Mint's
  Accessibility permission and quits with it. The separate Desktop Voice app is no longer needed.
- Fix: Mint no longer refuses to start without Desktop Voice, which made the 0.1.1 app unusable on
  other Macs. Without a TypeSafe key the `desktop` tool is hidden and Mint uses `ui_act`.
- `install.sh` creates its own persistent signing identity, so macOS keeps Mint's permissions
  across rebuilds without jev-use installed.
- `run.sh` no longer needs the Desktop Voice app.

## 0.1.1 (2026-09-28)

- Fix: the voice package and the example skills were left out of the repository (and the
  0.1.0 app) by an over-broad `.gitignore`. Tests now import every module.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-27)

First public release.

- Voice assistant for macOS on Gemini Live, with an on-device "Hey Mint" wake word and voice lock.
- 88 tools: apps and windows, clicking and typing through Accessibility, files, web search,
  full browser control, menus, screenshots, clipboard, calendar, reminders, notes, mail drafts.
- Showing things on screen (box, underline, highlight, circle, arrow) and 60 fps orb motion.
- Skills learned from experience and a searchable memory, both editable.
- Background agents (research, code, documents, Codex builds) shown as critters, with teams.
- Illustrated guide at https://hey-mint.pages.dev/.
- A downloadable app (DMG) with Python, libraries and models bundled, and a first-run window for the API keys.
